            2. WHAT PERSONAL DATA DO WE COLLECT?
          </h2>
          <p class="privacy-paragraph">
            The SMCC primarily collects information directly from its member
            company representatives or from others who have expressed interest in
            the organisation. The information collected is limited to contact
            details such as names, telephone numbers, emails, and addresses. The
            personal data is collected in order for us to provide the services
            that our members and partners expect and to make communications as
            effective and simple as possible.
          </p>
          <p class="privacy-paragraph">
            We collect personal data in connection with activities such as
            membership registration requests, signing up for the newsletter, or
            participating in our events and delegations. The information is most
            often collected directly from the data subject themselves through
            email, phone, or face-to-face meetings. In some cases, data may be
            collected via referral from colleagues or from publicly available
            sources such as company websites. We do not collect any sensitive
            personal data.
          </p>

          <h2 id="how-we-use" class="privacy-section-title">
            3. HOW WE USE YOUR INFORMATION
          </h2>
          <p class="privacy-paragraph">
            Our processing is used for direct communication and to uphold a
            relevant and appropriate relationship with our members, partners, and
            potential members according to what you would reasonably expect. We
            use your information to provide services that you have at some point
            expressed interest in. These services include, but are not limited
            to, event invitations, newsletters, special offers from other
            members, introductions to possible collaborators, and opportunities
            for exposure within the network through sponsorships or partnerships.
          </p>
          <p class="privacy-paragraph">
            Most of the time, the data is used to service our memberships and to
            inform our members about how they can participate in or contribute to
            upcoming activities. We may contact you by email or by phone, and you
            may simply request to stop receiving such information at any time. We
            use a third-party provider to deliver our newsletters and gather
            statistics about the number of email openings and clicks. We do not
            use any obtained data for profiling.
          </p>
          <p class="privacy-paragraph">
            We are very aware of the importance of protecting the data of our
            members, and we never share it with any third parties except for
            services we have contractual relationships with that do not use the
            data for their own purposes, such as email marketing providers or CRM
            systems. On some occasions, we may provide your name and company to
            event partners who are listed when signing up for that particular
            event. This is done only to ensure that the registration process is
            handled smoothly and securely. We also use cookies on our website
            (covered in section six).

            4. WHY DO WE COLLECT YOUR INFORMATION?
          </h2>
          <p class="privacy-paragraph">
            The reason we collect your information is that you decided to become
            a member or requested information from us in another matter. Thus, we
            keep your data in order to perform services in which you have
            expressed an interest. These could include event invitations,
            cooperation offers, and partnership opportunities. Apart from members,
            we are regularly contacted by people and institutions with an
            interest in Swedish-Macedonian trade and bilateral cooperation.

            5. OUR LEGITIMATE INTERESTS
          </h2>
          <p class="privacy-paragraph">
            The SMCC has chosen Legitimate Interest as the lawful basis for
            processing personal data. The reason we chose legitimate interest is
            that our data processing has minimal privacy impact and is in line
            with people’s reasonable expectations when signing up for a
            membership or contacting us for cooperation. Also, since there is no
            other reasonable or less intrusive way to achieve the same result,
            legitimate interest is the most appropriate lawful basis for
            processing our data. Furthermore, our Legitimate Interests
            Assessment (LIA) shows that our data processing is purposeful,
            necessary, and balanced with the individual’s interests. We consider
            this processing necessary and not inflicting any harm to individual
            rights and freedoms. Contact us if you wish to receive a copy of our
            LIA.
          </p>
          <p class="privacy-paragraph">
            The legitimate interests that we have identified are as follows:
            Direct communication and marketing – we send regular emails
            regarding upcoming events and collaboration opportunities. Relevant
            and appropriate relationship – as expected of a membership
            organisation, we know and communicate with most of our members
            regularly and treat them as clients. Thus, we keep data in order to
            secure this relationship, such as contact information and, where
            relevant, dietary requirements for event participation. Reasonable
            expectations – when signing up for a membership or participating in
            our events, it includes communication and informational updates from
            the Chamber. This is reasonable to expect from individuals who have
            willingly signed up for these activities. Reasonable expectations:
            When signing up for a membership, it includes a complimentary
            subscription to our magazine and thus we process addresses when
            distributing the magazine. This is reasonable to expect for the
            individual as they gladly signed up to get the magazine.
          </p>
